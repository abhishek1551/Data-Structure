# Spell Checker 
## Overview
This project is a spelling checker program designed to identify spelling errors in a given input file by comparing each word against a dictionary
of correctly spelled words. It uses a Doubly Linked List data structure, specifically implemented as a DLinkedBag (Doubly Linked Bag).
It outputs a list of any misspelled words found in the input file.

## Features
•  Dictionary Handling: Loads a dictionary file containing correctly spelled words.

•  Spell Checking: Scans through an input file and identifies misspelled words.

•  Output: Displays a list of misspelled words found in the input file.

## Components
•  DLinkedBag Data Structure: Implements a doubly linked list-based bag to store dictionary words and misspelled words.

•  Main Program Logic: Manages file reading, word comparison, and output generation.

## Files
  •  DLinkedBag.h and DLinkedBag.cpp: Implementation of the DLinkedBag class.
  
  •  main.cpp: Main function to execute the spelling checker program.
